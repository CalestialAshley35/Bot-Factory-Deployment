Welcome to **Bot Factory Deployment**! This system is designed to help you easily deploy your Python-based Discord bots directly from Replit Mobile.

## Getting Started

To deploy your bot using this system, follow the steps below:

### 1. Access the Project

You can access the project directly on Replit: [Bot Factory Deployment](https://replit.com/@calestialashley/Bot-Factory-Deployment?s=app).

### 2. Set Up Your Bot

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure that the required dependencies are listed in your `requirements.txt` file. For a basic Discord bot, include:
   ```
   discord.py
   ```

2. **Bot Code**: Place your bot’s code in the `main.py` or `bot.py` file. Here’s a basic example to get started:
   ```python
   import discord
   from discord.ext import commands

   intents = discord.Intents.default()
   intents.messages = True

   bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", intents=intents)

   @bot.event
   async def on_ready():
       print(f'Bot is online!')

   bot.run(os.getenv("TOKEN"))
   ```

### 3. Add Your Bot Token

To securely manage your bot's token:

1. Go to the **Secrets** tab in Replit.
2. Add a new secret with the key `TOKEN` and paste your Discord bot token as the value.

### 4. Automate Deployment

The `.replit` file is already configured to automatically run your bot:

```ini
run = "python3 bot.py"
```

### 5. Run and Deploy

Simply click the **Run** button in Replit Mobile to start your bot. It should come online in your Discord server almost instantly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure your bot token is correctly set in the **Secrets** tab.
- Double-check that all dependencies are installed.
- Check the Replit console for any error messages or logs that might indicate what’s wrong.
